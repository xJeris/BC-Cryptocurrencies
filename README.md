## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning tools to classify cryptocurrencies.

1. Prepare the cryptocurrency dataset by dropping unneeded columns, using get_dummies, and scaling the remaining data using StandardScalar
2. Reduce the data dimensions to 3 using PCA.
3. Find the appropriate K value for clustering using an Elbow Curve.
4. Create a 3-D scatter plot of our results.
